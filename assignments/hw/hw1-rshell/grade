Did not follow specs create a hw1 tag for this assignmment. Will need to resubmit. See https://github.com/mikeizbicki/ucr-cs100/issues/36 for more details.

Problems:
-25  for not properly having the number of perror per syscall 

	number of syscalls... 6
	number of perror..... 1
	grade modifier....... -25
-5 no exec branch 
I stopped checking other problems since you did not follow the specs 
NOTE: Don't forget to show all the cases you test. For this assignment was a little lenient. In the future test more throughly.
